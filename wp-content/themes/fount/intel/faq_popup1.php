        <h2>What is Opaxe?</h2>

        <p>
            Opaxe is an online interactive map and database repository that displays and stores public reports for
            mineral exploration and mining projects globally. The majority of the projects included are undertaken
            by companies listed on the major global stock exchanges.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mineral exploration projects are represented by pins on the map. When any pin is clicked a window shows
            all public reports (Announcements and Technical Reports) available for that project. Along with a
            download link to each report, the window shows summary information such as the resource statement, best
            drill intersections, name of the QP/CP, etc. All data displayed on the Opaxe interactive map is
            available in the public domain.
            A database of Transaction Reports is also provided which displays and stores global reports published
            since April 2017 relating to transactions of mineral exploration, resource development, and mining
            properties, including property acquisitions, company acquisitions and takeovers. Reported transactions
            are represented by pins on the map. A summary of any transaction report may be viewed by clicking on a
            pin, and the full report may be downloaded from the summary. Viewing and downloading transaction reports
            is subject to membership of a relevant Opaxe subscription plan.
        </p>

        <p>
            Filters are available for both the Technical Reports and the Transaction Reports to display user-defined
            subsets of the overall data. Projects can be filtered by various criteria including commodity type,
            date, project status, stock exchange the company is listed on, reporting code, report type, and
            transaction size and type. Users are able to set and save their preferred filters allowing immediate
            access to reports based on these preferences. A search tool is available allowing users to search for
            specific projects, code, competent persons and other relevant fields. Usage of pre-set and saved
            filters, together with the ability to view reports based on selections of commodities, project status,
            report type, stock exchange listing etc is subject to user registration to an Opaxe subscription plan.

        <h3>Opaxe concept</h3>
        <p>
            The Opaxe map and database was originally designed and developed by RSC as a free intelligence tool for
            the mineral industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            By monitoring public reports and displaying these spatially, it can be easily visualised, for example,
            which commodities are being reported on most, which geographic locations are most active, how many new
            resources are reported, and which reporting codes are used. It then becomes easy to generate trend
            plots, for instance, showing trends in reporting activity. As a source of information, the map and
            databases are a valuable resource for activities such as target acquisition, market research, resource
            comparison, and for investors, regulators and codes (AusIMM, AIG, ASX, JORC, NI43-101, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            Opaxe acquired the RSC Mineral Intelligence service in 2019. We are continually adding reports to the
            databases in all categories, increasing the value of our service to our users.
        </p>

        <div id="reports-database" class="fixed-headers"></div>
        <h3>Types of reports included in the database</h3>
        <p>
            Two categories of reports are included; Technical Reports concerning mineral exploration and mining
            projects; and Transaction Reports concerning reported transactions of mineral projects at any stage of
            development.
            Technical reports mostly includes reports that are positioned on the central part of the mining value
            chain (Figure 1). Projects where substantial exploration work is being completed are of main interest
            and therefore public reports on the results of early exploration activities such as mapping or soil
            sampling programmes are not included. Similarly, results for established mines (such as reserve updates
            based on different cut-off grades) are not included as they have little bearing on the “activity
            monitor”.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transaction reports covers transactions of any size/value of mineral projects at all stages of
            development from exploration through to developed mines on care and maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also monitor Environmental Impact Assessment reports (EIAs, Code -unrelated) and reports supporting
            acquisitions (mostly NI 43-101).

        <h3>Update frequency</h3>
        <p>
            We update our databases on a daily basis. We do not provide a ‘real-time’ service, we aim to make most
            new reports available within 72 hours of their publication.
        </p>


        <div id="download-links" class="fixed-headers"></div>
        <h3>Links to public reports</h3>
        <p>
            Each project pin on the map includes the download link to the public report. Where possible, we try to
            include the technical Documentation that goes with the Public Report. For NI43-101 reports, this will be
            added when it is made available through SEDAR up to 40 days after the Public Report. In the case of
            JORC, this documentation may not always be available for download.
        </p>

        <div id="codes" class="fixed-headers"></div>
        <h3>Codes</h3>
        <p>
            Most of the public reporting is based on the NI 43-101 and JORC Codes. These are displayed on the map
            using either an “N” or “J” within the pin. Other Codes are displayed using an “O”. There may be reports
            where the Code affiliation may not be provided. This may be a breach of listing rules or otherwise may
            simply be because the reporting company is private. We treat “public” announcements by private companies
            as Public Reports.
