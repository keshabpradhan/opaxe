		<h3>Our Company</h3>
		<p>RSC originally analysed listed mining company announcements to build up a picture of the global mining industry. Realising that mining companies in general would benefit from their work, RSC began offering a free service allowing users to view and download published reports. To begin to quantify exploration results the company produced a weekly list in which announced drilling results were converted to an Au equivalent result and ranked against each other, producing tables of the top intersections by stock exchange listing in different time periods.</p>
		<p>Opaxe was formed in March of 2019 to take over the existing operations of RSC’s Mineral Intelligence service and to continue to develop and expand the service. Our clients include mining professionals, investors and brokers, mining companies and the media.</p>

		<h3>How we work</h3>
		<p>Opaxe is a repository for reports published by resources companies listed on the world’s major stock exchanges. Although these reports are available in the public domain they are not always easy to find. We display these reports, represented by pins, on an interactive map. Clicking on a pin brings up a window showing all reports available for the company and/or project associated with the pin. There is a download link for each report and a summary of the information available including a resource statement, best drill intersections, and the name of the QP/CP, etc.</p>
		<p>Reports can be filtered by various criteria including commodity type, date, project status, stock exchange the company is listed on, reporting code, report type, and transaction size and type. Our users can set their preferred filters which allows them to immediately access reports based on their selected preferences, and there is a search tool allowing users to search for specific projects, stock market listing codes, competent persons and other relevant fields.</p>
		<p>Opaxe is a subscription-based service. Non-registered users are able to view technical reports relating to gold projects. Registration to one of our subscription plans is required to view and download reports relating to any other commodity, to set up and use filter preferences, and to search for reports based on selections of commodities, project status, report type, stock exchange listing etc. Our subscribers also receive regular updates and bulletins relating to activity in the minerals sector.<span id="aboutus-link-to-plan"> Details of our subscription plans can be seen <a href="#" onclick="register_from();">here.</a></span><span id="aboutus-link-to-plan-mobile">Please access the site on a larger device to view the details on our subscription plans.</span></p>

		<h3>Our data</h3>
		<p>We have two main types of reports; Technical Reports concerning mineral exploration and mining projects; and Transaction Reports relating to transactions of mineral projects at any stage of development. Technical Reports mostly relate to projects that are positioned on the central part of the mining value chain while Transaction Reports cover all stages of the mining value chain (see diagram below).</p>
		<p>We update our databases on a daily basis and most new reports are available within 72 hours of their initial publication.</p>
